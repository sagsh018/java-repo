1) So in Java we have meny types of lists
	a) ArrayList
	b) LinkedList
	c) Stack
	d) Vector
	
2) Practically we will only talk about the first three written above 
3) Let us see the pros and cons of all these lists one by one

ArrayList
=========

Pros
1) Fast to access the data due to index value just like an Array
2) Easy to access any element from any location because the elements are stored in continuous memory locations and can be referred by the index
	locations, same as that of an Array
3) ArrayList can be expanded, that is elements can be added at any point of time and not like an Array where once the size is defined, you cannot
	expand or contract the size, so expansion and contraction in ArrayList is possible at any given time.
	
Cons
1) Operations in ArrayLists are slow, for example if you want to remove some element from the ArrayList, then it will not happen inplace, it will
	create another ArrayList with the modified state.
	so operations on ArrayList like addition, removing, updating the elements takes time
2) and becasue the operations are not inplace in ArrayList, because of that they consume more memory.

Stack
=====
Stack is a LIFO List where the operations only take place on the top. The operations in Stack as we follows: push and pop
So the Stack class represents a last-in-first-out(LIFO) stack of object.
it extends the Vector class
The vector is similar to ArrayList. The only difference is that Vector class methods are synchronized whereas ArrayList class methods are not.
below are the methods for Stack Class in java
a) empty(): To test if the stack is empty or not
b) peek() : looks at the object at the top of a stack without removing it
c) pop() : removes the object from the top of a stack and return this object as the value of this function
d) push() : pushes an item on the top of a stack
e) search(Object o) : returns 1-based position where an object is on stack

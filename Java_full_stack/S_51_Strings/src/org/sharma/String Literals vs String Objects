So there are two types with which we can define String class elements.
1) String Literals
	They can be simply defined using 
	String literal_name1 = value1 ( Now suppose this is value 1)
	String literal_name2 = value1 (So now literal_name1 and 2 both are having same values inside them, so what java will do, java will create one 
	memory location and store value1 and create to memory references/pointers for both the literals
	and in this case if you check literal_name1 == literal_name2, then you will get it as true
	
2) String object
	this can be defined using new
	String str1 = new String("Hello World");
	String str2 = new String("Hello World");
	now here str1 and str2 are object of class String and in this case even though both the objects have same value but java will create separate
	reference for them inside momory. but in this case "==" will not give the correct result, and we will have to use .equals() method
	
Take aways
1) Use String literals instead of objects, Java do the memory optimization in this case
2) Use String class methods in order to do the comparisons, concatination, replacements, etc.

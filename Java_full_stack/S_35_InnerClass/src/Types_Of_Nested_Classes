There are two types of nested classes
1) Static Nested class
2) Non static nested class

Non static nested classes are further classified as :
a) Member inner class
b) Local inner class
c) Anonymous inner class

Member inner class
==================
We have already seen the example of these types of classes in this lecture. examples are Engine and Lock classes
So member inner class is a non static class inside a non static class

Local inner class
==================
This is a class inside a scope of a code block and this code block could be a method as well, and local inner class
has a scope limited to that code block only. we will see the example of this in further videos.

Anonymous inner class
=====================
This is a name less class inside a class. So there is no name to class and since it has no name so it can be used only
once in the lifetime.

Now this Non static nested class branch is simply called as inner class, and this is due to the fact that, an instance of
a non static inner class contains the instance of a inner class. or we can say that the instance is inside the other
instance.

Static Nested classes
=====================
None of the static nested class is required to be accessed with the help of object or an instance and we can directly
access the elements inside the static class
We will see the functionality of static keyword, before checking the static nested classes in further videos.
